# [Nerve](https://tkellehe.github.io/nerve) (Alpha)

_Nerve_ is a programming language built around simple neural networks.
The language is a code golfing language that instead of providing a set
of instructions or commands to golf down code, you teach a neural network
to complete the challenge. It takes a string of characters and returns a 
a string of characters.

## Alpha

[testing page](https://tkellehe.github.io/nerve/test/) is provided to play around with
the underlying components.
